Subject: And immediately began preparing to go to work. It 

And immediately began preparing to go to work. It was 2am but for her the day was just starting. She didn't drink instead she gulped her coffee, grabbed her keys, slid a very thick folder into her bag and left the building. In her parking garage there was a tall  vehicle.  You couldn't tell what it was because it was dark and misty and whatever it was it was painted black. Without fear of the shadows or any concern for the dangers that the nighttime brings on a night like this in a neighborhood like that, Ty abruptly slipped into the darkness, opened a door to witch sound mostly resembled a hatch and got on.
