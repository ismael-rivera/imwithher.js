AND I TELL YOU FOR LAST TIME!!! THE PACKAGE IS ALREADY BACK ON ROUTE TO YOU. THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO FROM HERE. THIS IS NOT MY FAULT. 

WE WERE EXPECTING THE PACKAGE TO ARRIVE AT OUR HOUSE. WE LIVE AND WORK HERE. WE ARE ALWAYS HERE. 

I PAID AND YET I RECEIVED NOTHING. 

YOU CAN BLAME THE POST OFFICE ALL YOU WANT BUT IN THE END IT IS YOU, YES YOU!! 

WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE UNTIL I RECEIVE PACKAGE IN MY HANDS OUR TRANSACTION IS NOT COMPLETE. YOU GOT MY MONEY DELIVERED TO STRAIGHT TO YOUR ACCOUNT. IF THE BANK MADE A MISTAKE. I WOULD STILL HAVE TO PAY YOU, ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM ME NOT RECEIVING MY PACKAGE WHEN I ALREADY PAID FOR IT.

SINCE I DID NOT RECEIVE PACKAGE IN MY HANDS AND GAVE YOU MY MONEY. YOU!!!!!! ARE!!!!!! RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING THE GOODS PURCHASED!!!!!! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET THE POST OFFICE TO GIVE ME BACK MY REFUND OR MY PACKAGE? THEY DON'T DO THAT. THEY SAID ONCE IT'S ON ROUTE TO YOU. IT'S ON ROUTE TO YOU. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSACTION. THEY DON'T CHANGE PACKAGE DESTINATION MIDWAY, YOU IDIOT!!! YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS!!!!

CLEARLY YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE THIS AND YOU WANT TO KEEP MY MONEY AND BLAME SOMEONE ELSE FOR YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO OUR SELLER BUYER CONTRACT. I AM TIRED OF DEALING WITH YOU. I WILL SEEK ALIEXPRESS MEDIATION. MAYBE, I GET BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM THEM.

YOU ARE A VERY BAD AND IRRESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PERSON. NOT ONCE DID YOU EVEN OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION TO MINE. YOU COULDNT EVEN MEET ME HALFWAY.

KNOW THIS… IF I DON'T GET MY MONEY BACK IN MEDIATION… I WILL FIND A WAY TO TELL EVERYONE ON THIS SITE:

1. HOW POORLY YOU TREAT YOUR DISTRESSED CUSTOMERS WHEN PROBLEMS ARISE
2. HOW YOU BLAME THEM AND OTHERS FOR THINGS THAT ARE YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY
3. HOW YOU ARE UNREASONABLE AND CONSTANTLY COMPLAIN BLAMING THE POST OFFICE INSTEAD OF OFFERING SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE THE ISSUE.
4. HOW YOU HAVE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER OF SALESMANSHIP (IF YOU WERE A SMART PERSON YOU COULD HAVE CONVINCED ME TO BUY SOMETHING ELSE AND RESEND WITH PACKAGE INSTEAD OF CRYING LIKE A BABY YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE MONEY OUT OF AN INCONVENIENT SITUATION. THAT OPPORTUNITY IS NOW GONE. I NEVER WANT TO DEAL WITH YOU AGAIN.)
5. HOW YOU INSULT YOUR CUSTOMERS BY TREATING THEM LIKE CHILDREN AND CONDENSCENDING THEM BY CALLING THEM YOUR "FRIEND" WHILE YOU SPIT IN THEIR FACES. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO INSULTED IN MY LIFE BY AN ONLINE STORE.
6. HOW YOU ARE OBLIVIOUS AT HOW POOR YOU ARE AT YOUR JOB. THE ONLY WAY I CAN CONCEIVE YOU RECEIVE GOOD RATINGS ON THIS SITE IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOMEHOW FOUND A WAY TO CHEAT OR YOU ONLY GET GOOD MARKS BECAUSE SO FAR YOU'VE BEEN LUCKY.

and most importantly… 

7. HOW YOU STOLE MY MONEY. CLAIMED IT AS YOUR OWN BEFORE THE ENTIRE TRANSACTION WAS CONCLUDED AND JUDGING BY YOUR ATTITUDE, THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST TIME, I BET YOU LEAVE PEOPLE EMPTY HANDED AND TOOK THEIR MONEY. 

YOU SIR ARE A THIEF. A LOWLIFE AND A HORRIBLE MERCHANT. ALIEXPRESS SHOULD NOT ALLOW PEOPLE LIKE YOU ON THEIR SERVERS. AND YOU ARE NO FRIEND OF MINE SO DON'T PRETEND TO BE MY FRIEND. PAY ME BACK MY MONEY OR I WILL MAKE SURE EVERY ONE ON THIS SITE GETS FAIR WARNING BEFORE DEALING WITH YOUR SHITTY STORE.
