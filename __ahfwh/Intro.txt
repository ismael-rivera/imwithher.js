“More often than not it brings a message. Or not… but… sometimes…I mean sometimes ...It means something”.

For Molly and I, it was Coalescence, 
[ ]
The day we met. 
It was as obvious to me, as it was to her. 
We were made for each other.
[ ]
Now… thats not to say that We were not
[ ]
Me? I was a bad, bad guy. She was even worse. Us Together? 
but then again…
[ ]
The best thing that ever happened to a couple of bad ideas was a little daughter named Hope.
[ ]
Yes siree. The day me and my wife met we spent the whole day riding a bicycle that didn’t work, on a day that wasn’t particularly a good day for a bike ride, in a town that did not take kindly to strangers.

millions of molecules of atmospheric vapor condensing into water droplets and fusing together until they become so large that heaven itself can no longer sustain them. 
[ ]
And so they fall.
[ ]
I suppose I can appreciate the irony in that natural law that has placed me inthi
[ ]
I could spend a lifetime 
[ ]
and yet of all the elements in the universe that stick out from my youth. The one that I meditate on the most is the rain. 
[ ]
It always reminds me of the day I met my wife.
[ ]
Wife: Hey you. What’s your name?
[ ]
I think of her soft white skin and how the glimmer of the rain on the window drops reflected on her body.
[ ]
We made love the same day we met but not before staying up late talking philosophy for hours.    
[ ]
She told me there was a wholeness within us that we brought into this world. All of us.
[ ] 
How it was ours to give bit by bit, through our lifetime. And in return, if we were lucky, we would get some of it back.
[ ] 
That wholeness was our own little infinite Universe. It was like a little box that carried our hopes and dreams, our fears. Our deepest desires.
[ ]
If I could keep that box closed… 
[ ]
...not share any of it and save it all. 
[ ]
I would give it all to you.  
[ ]
Then nothing else would matter.
[ ]
I do not know if you can hear me.
All of it… 
[ ]

How easily that which slowly empties out defines us. 
The good ones, would say some corny shit about how they met their wife… but I had this dream. Before I even met her.
[ ] 
It was the ebb and flow of her body and the way it moved in the liquid ether. 
[ ]
It was the way we floated together.
[ ]
I remember the blue and red lights outside the window and the feeling I felt when it was all over.
[ ]
Kilter. 
[ ]
and when I saw your eyes. I walked into an emerald mine that caved in on my ego, all that false bravado, all my fears, all my failed expectations, all that bullshit. Everything underneath me it swallowed whole. And just like that… I was it’s slave. It was my home.  
I would die for eternity with you…  
[ ]
The city of colors and paintings… 
[ ]
and love 
it could only have brought me to you. I grew up in the largest cityscape in our star system. [ ]
[shot of spaceship thrusters at very low cruising speed traveling across space through a cloud of dust as if it where an empty dark road in the middle of the night during a calm blizzard]
And so… like the empty vessel they have made out of me, I wonder the void, endlessly. In search.
[ ]
Give our daughter a kiss. Tell her that I travel far and wide in hopes of meeting her again. Tell her that it will take some time, but I promise, that when I finally meet my end in this nightmare, my spirit will soar and the star systems will tremble with the sound of my heart screaming with joy, racing at the speed of thought to be at her side. I love you both so much.

My name is _______________ and not long ago I left 
[ ]
It is by which right I intend to document my passage through the now wasteland that is my existence on this realm. Should Mother Starlight grant you the will to watch over us and should you ever find yourself capable of forgiving me, my love. please know that my resolute is ever stout. My hand ever steady. My will, however impure, is never unbinding. I am on my way to you but not before, my love, not before… I will punish those responsible for what they did to you and my daughter.

Even though we don’t speak the same language, eat the same food or come from the same place. Even though we may not have the same line of work or share the same pass time, my hope is that whomever this message reaches, you and I will have that one thing in common. That we will find common ground in this…we all share lives with people we care for. People we love. Wether it be in your corner of the galaxy or light years away. I sincerely hope that whoever this message reaches you will be safe and free from the torments that have forced me to write this message. In so doing I pray you take heed of the story I am about to relate.
[ ]
My name is Qhissi Mophaola and it pains me to write. I am the last of my people.  
[ ]
I was born in Quatar Kliebah. It is the name of my star system. It resides 23.5 light years from your star system. In it we have 2 populated planets. My home planet is known as Ilihi. I suppose in your tongue a direct translation to this might mean “great dawn”. Our sun is a red dawrf and it glows a subtle hue of reds that resemble your more like your sunsets. Since ours is a binary system, we have no night, since we have no night, I suppose this is somewhat of a bad name. For us Ilihi has another meaning. Ilihi means harmony.
[ ]
Our world is one of constant subtleties. Work was very tranquil because we concentrated. 
And and when the first sun falls we lounge. There were no wars in my world 
[ ]
The radiation from our sun
the extreme high pressures one but ithey also allowed us to develop something else. Crystals. With the help of our scientists we could manipulate light and magnetism
