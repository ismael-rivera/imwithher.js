was in his office looking at porn with a dull look on his face. There was a lot of noise outside
He was bored out of his mind normally but today his mind seemed at ease with that boredom almost as if it was the last day of school before summer and he was just waiting for the bell to ring. But it wouldn’t. He was in his office. It was a canning factory that his family owned on the lower west side of the pier(find a location). 
The phone immediately begins to ring 
Restaurant
Russian restaurant
Man sitting in bar feeling nostalgic
He remembers traveling to Russia
And thinking it was going to be awful but instead what happened is he now 
Wishes he was still there
Meets the owner of bar who is Russian
Owner invites him to dinner at his table and ask some questions which at first seem random
Little by little the man realizes that the owner knows a lot more about him than he really should
Owner offers man an explanation in the form of a question
How certain are you of who and what you are?
The owner then reveals himself to be an alien
His here on earth posing as a movie director
He wants the man to be in his movie
The man agrees
We will call him Gerald
Gerald is told telepathically that he is to become one of the most beloved movie stars on earth but he most first prove his worthiness
They get up and the owner asks Gerald to go to the front of the restaurant and wait with all the rest of the celebrities. 
Awkwardness ensues as soon as Gerald walks in they all see he doesn't belong there but nonetheless the treat him like he's some kind of extra which causes Gerald to feel inadequate about his status
Gerald wants more
He wants to be like them
Famous
Important
Loved
He begins listening in on the conversation
Fellow Actor and movie star Jonah hill is there telling re acounting of a funny anecdote about just coming from Cannes and most of the group there is laughing as they all seem to have been there
They're all with their girlfriends and tuxedos and high class entourage
Gerald quickly begins to feel as if he's been left out and yet desperately wants to be part of the conversation
He immediately almost as if by subconscious (find a better word) manner reverts back to what the owner told him. You will be a movie star, you will be famous, people will love you.
He thought to himself “Fuck It! I can do this”. Gerard knew he would eventually become famous. Something in his gut told him to ignore the pain. Ignore the feeling of inadequecy, ignore those snivelling people thinking they were better than you.” Ignore those idiots. Fame comes in groups. That’s not your group, but they will come to know you. People will love you. Ignore them, Ignore ignore.” 
All of a sudden it came to his mind that he should meet with the director right away to begin preparing for his first movie. 
And so Gerald walked into the restaurant again to meet up with the owner. The owner let him know that everything had been setup already and that they were good to go. Before anything else could be discussed Gerald quickly noticed that there were curtains, Big giant curtains in the middle of the restaurant. To him it was almost strange that while he had been eating there he never noticed these massive curtain that rode all the way up to the ceiling and were right in the middle of the room. This gigantic ball room with these gigantic curtains that were covering something. What the hell is inside that thing God only knows but before Gerald could even guess the owner was opening the curtains revealing a massive fish tank that had absolutely no fish, but it was filled to the top with kind of clear liquid. Gerald had no idea but somehow he knew that the liquid was not exactly water.
And yet the strangest things, as if the whole situation wasn’t weird enough, his first question which should have begun with what was nowhere to be found. Instead Gerald surprised himself with the howling question that oddly enough would begin to unravel in his mind what was truly going on: “Why?!!” He yelled out. Not knowing why he yelled that question out? Even more surprising was the owner’s demeanor which was almost as if he was expecting the question. The owner points to the tank with the clear liquid and he calmly says because it’s part of your role. Quickly Gerald felt a sense of relief from those words. He didn’t know why nor how but immediately this warm homey feeling that had gradually but unconsciously been building it’s way through his system had now boiled over and taken over him so powerfully that it took him almost 30 full seconds to realize that he had been crying the entire time since the moment when he first saw the tank.
I’m sorry ”Gerald” quickly cried out. Not knowing why he was sobbing uncontrollably. The owner gently smiled and placed his hand on Geralds shoulder in a friendly manner and let him know it was all going to be fine. At this point Gerald could not speak but he knew that he had to go into the tank. The owner quickly said

as fresh blood dripped down the severed artery, Tyson quickly began thinking about his garden, and his tomato plants exactly matched the colour of the bright red blood dripping from the man’s hand.

    Just saw the discussion above, about the value that is perceived, and that is right at the point we are going through today. I believe that if a person cannot see the inherent value that a service provides, he will always think it is expensive. If he can see that value, than he will never think it is expensive, because it will bring more benefits than he is paying for, and that is the kind of costumer you want to do walk that extra mile for.

        Thiago, thanks for jumping in. That’s exactly the point – if you would know that you can put 1 dollar in machine and get 2 dollars out wouldnt you do it?

        The same way we all buy products because we know what we can do with that knowledge or service to multiply our income. Good rule to remember is each product we buy should give us 10x in return..otherwise either product is bad or we are not doing what we should.

And immediately began preparing to go to work. It was 2am but for her the day was just starting. She didn't drink instead she gulped her coffee, grabbed her keys, slid a very thick folder into her bag and left the building. In her parking garage there was a tall  vehicle.  You couldn't tell what it was because it was dark and misty and whatever it was it was painted black. Without fear of the shadows or any concern for the dangers that the nighttime brings on a night like this in a neighborhood like that, Ty abruptly slipped into the darkness, opened a door to witch sound mostly resembled a hatch and got on.

Remembered it well. She moved the truck inside the site. There where no gates to get inside. Ty took the truck and drove it the middle of the field

It was an open grounds wear house on the east front of the riverbank that had an open enough field on the port side. A sign on the entrance said Hiertzciv Marine Development construction site for the new dry docks. This is the place, she thought. She 

The where house near Baldrige river on the eastern docks. Localization she thought was familiar as it was once the place where she trained as an operative. She quickly arrived at her destination and began surveying the area

Ty got off of the exit ramp onto the highway and her phone began to ring. She quickly answered to which a man on the other side of the line with an eloquent voice began to give her instructions. The instructions were to proceed to 

But it carried a weight in it's construction that penetrated the vileness of the setting in which it was in. After the sound of engine murmur continued for awhile the vehicle finally took off.

It had been fitted with steel bearings on the sides of the top fenders. They were dark from an alloy of some kind. There were also two quarterpounder side panels blocking the side view from the navigator seat and a six foot leak pump that was chrome and let downwards and up through the chassis of the truck onto a middle rail on the back that seemed to carry an antenna array. The truck was not attached to any carts oe

Clinks and clanks and then silence again. The murmur of adiesel engine followed by a. Dry abrupted ramming noise and the vehicle was now running. It was a truck, one of the large cross country diesel kind. Like the ones they use to hawl steel columns, only this one was different.

The darkness enveloped her now. A few our corner. Everyone is just annoyed that it's what brought the music to our corner.

Fuck you fuck your mother Eat a dick!! The guy from 315 yelled out of his window. 

Nightclub music playing next door. Ty could hear it even under her pillow as she attempted to sleep. The music was coming from the corner across the street where an old building had just been remodeled by its new tenants. The street pressed hooker squad working of the corner on the opposite side of that same block had been run off by some new street gang of sorts. Nobody knew what the real deal was. Everyone was only annoyed that it's what brought those people onto o

Nightclub music. What a soul draining carcass of shitty combinations from other music mixed in with noise and subwoofers that drench out the meaningless existence that these people have carved for themesves.

This shit was too much. Ty got up from her bed and began dressing

Chapter 5 Blueprint

"How's Atticus?" First words out of Neil as soon as he saw Tyson. Tyson Blake didn't even flinch for a second before bolting like a guided missile onto Neil and grabbing him by the throat. Like a hammer dropping into a metal barrel, the tension bell rang in Barry's ear as he and the deckmate immediately sprunt towards the hope of separating the two. Tyson didn't even notice the ruckus on his behalf as his eyes give dead center to Neil's. He presses his thumb and index and raises Neil against the hull of the deck with one hand while pushing him forward towards the other. As they both hit the deck's hull Tyson mockingly grunted back at Neil while choking the life out of him: "Ahhh! You know how it is. It's all good buddy." And with the same swiftness that the rage came over him it just as well dissipated. Tyson knew he needed Neil for this mission. He needed the crew of the ship to trust his orders and worst of all he knew he needed the great Neil Roberts to carry the mission out. As much as he hated him, he needed him. Tyson arduously eased the grip on Neil's larynx as the crisp cackling sound of air signaled hope back into his captive's eyes Neil began to resume consciousness he realized he was now bent over kneeling on the floor. His chest exasperated as the oxygen drew back into his lungs. He struggled halfhearted and took a few deep breaths before getting back on his fist and lunging the entire weight of his body onto Tyson. In what almost seemed like an all too familiar coordination Tyson calmly just slid right as Neil bolted past him.

 In absolute stupor Neil plowed into a bunch of crab cages but not before pulling on a winch lever that was hoisting the buntline holding Barry's tools on the mast. With that the tools came crashing down momentarily distracting Tyson and the others. When Tyson looked back he saw Neil coming at him with a left hook that would have connected if not for Tyson drifting the punch towards his right shoulder. It was an Aikido move that Neil had seen many times before and knew all to well so instead of following up with a right uppercut he threw his whole body forward and grappled Tyson to the floor. That did nothing. Tyson just smiled and wrapped his boots and legs across Neil's back and pinned Neil's arms against his and began tumbling and rolling towards the bridge door. Once there, the dock master hit the bell as by now everyone on the docks was watching the fight. Barry came over and stood over them and told Tyson: "Alright, you crazy fuck. I think you won. Let'im go." To which Tyson respectfully replied: "Fuck you, old man. Stay out of it." "Ok. I tried" said Barry to the MP's who took out their stun batons which were really just cattle prods with a carbon fiber outfitting and proceeded to hit Tyson and Neil like they were both cinco de mayo piñatas.

When they both woke up, they were both wrapped up and naked in serran wrap

Atticus walks into the building along his men all of them in fatigues all of the armed to the gills except for Atticus who has 2 side pistols. One is a beretta. The other one is hidden in a Baggie tarp that drapes over the side listens for signs of disturbance after he orders the pilot to shut down the engine. He walks into building as if he owns the place. His men on the lookout but he pays no mind to the sorroundings as he heads straight towards the stairs through a walkway filled with men all with automatic rifles and scopes. Each one of the men is positioned next to one of the large corner of windows. There is unrest in the air as murmuring voices signal the arrival of Atticus. Three men sitting on the floor that has been covered with a rubber tarp making no sound whatsoever one of the men the Latino the Mexican raises his hand and immediately the room falls silent. The man in the middle signals in an inviting manner to sit. Atticus takes a look around the room as he scans all the faces his gaze pauses at a distant corner of the hall. He walks towards it grabs a chair places it in front of the gang members and sits looking down on them in mocking fashion. The room falls dead silent now as the view from the men's perspective now plainly reveals all the guns pointed at each other with three tribal gang leaders sitting on the floor like a trio of jackasses and Atticus on his chair looking like he's about to tell a bedtime story to a room full of children. Atticus reaches into his pocket both sides of course cock their guns. Atticus takes out a cigar and begins lighting it up. 
"Do you know who I am?" Said Atticus
"Yeah, we know who you are." Said the gang member in the middle.
"I'm the guy who the guy the White House sends to negotiate with terrorists" said Atticus with a big smile. Cigar in his mouth.
"Is that what you came to do cuero? You here to negotiate dash puto?" Said one of the leaders.
Atticus takes a bigger puff from his Cigar gives and laughs while looking back to his men but quickly turn his head back very serious towards the leader puts out his cigar on the floor.
"you got no options here...well you got one really"
"Oh yeah what's that?"
Atticus smiles yet again. Gimme the hostages.
"What no returns?"
"No cuero. no returns."
The room gets quiet all of a sudden. Not because people have stopped talking. More like something in the air has drastically changed
There is a vacuum forming everyone can feel it. It takes a second for the gang members to realize there's no sound from anything. They can't hear the people rioting in the streets nor the sirens. They cannot hear anything. There is literally a dead vacuuming silence. The realization only last as long as took for it to arrive as the walls explode with another wall more like a river of bullets in leashed at such a precise and horizontal angle that not a single one manages to hit either the floor of the room nor any of the men including Atticus who was sitting no more than two feet away from the targets. Light shatters through as not just the windows but the walls on both end explode in a pattern that would easily simulate desintegration

All the windows explode with a hail of bullets more like an endless Ray of rounds that disintegrate and explode everything in their path. Rapid fire of such a high rate of dispersion that the  rounds become incendiary burn even the atmosphere around the targets. It only takes 1.6 seconds before the entire command structure of the gangas has been converted tu a large burnt pulp. All that is left of the room can only be seen through a large wall of concrete smoke and the rays of the sun coming in from the ceiling that once was.

All the men were already in position as there is no time to take cover. Commander Atticus is sitting in his chair relighting his cigar admiring the savagery of the carnage.

Benitez character story arc was a gang member since he was 8 years old. Got into businesses at some point with the Arian brotherhood. The white supremacists end up killing his brother by castrating him and hanging him off a highway sign post. Benitez and his gang retaliated by burying their whole crew alive in mountain of rubble in the  mining fields. But then Benitez gets pinned down by one of the Arians brother and thrown into a wood chopper. Apparently the wood chopper was really old or was one of those pieces of machinery that had to be kept in service. Cause at some point in the midst of the agonizing screams the machine breaks down and when the Arian brother goes to see what's up. His face turns whiter even and he just gives a look to the others and then just bolts out of there like there's no tomorrow. But from that night on the word was that the motherfucker had survived that shit.

 in the future there exists a technology that allows people to not only remember their past lives but also claim those lives legally and any assets or penalties belonging. The clean ones with no past criminal records are referred to as "slates". The ones with past debts and crimes are known as "backloggers". These backloggers are assigned special entrance as "clean slates" only when all debts, grievances, and sentences have been payed, addressed and carried out. Until then all backloggers have one and only one priority. To carry out their assignments.

ISFJ: Introvert Sensing Feeling Judging. Tip #1 For a story to be exciting it has to show not tell what is happening. You want your reader to feel that he or she is there experiencing what is going on. For example, being told that ‘the dog bit the man, and the man bit back’ is telling and not showing. Instead of telling, try Tip #2. Tip #2 It is always good to start your story with something happening. A story that begins with action is likely to be more gripping for the reader than, say, description. ‘Ouch!’ the man yelled when the dog bit him. Tip #3 We live in a technicolour world. Bring attention to the vivid colours around us. The man’s blood dripped down into the hole the dog had dug. The ripe tomatoes on the dug-up tomato plants exactly matched the colour of the bright red blood dripping from the man’s hand. Tip #4 Try a different perspective or point of view. Another way to think of point of view is to imagine the story as it is seen through another character’s eyes. Sometimes writing your story from a different point of view can change the effect completely. In the following section, the focus shifts from the man’s point of view to the dog’s. The dog snarled, baring his white sharp teeth. He’d thought burying his bone would keep it safe, but this intruder had found it anyway. Tip #5 Add dialogue. Too much narrative (telling) can bog a story down. Adding dialogue can make it more exciting for your reader. ‘Digging holes in my garden!’ the man yelled. He wound his white handkerchief around his hand, and it quickly grew spotted with red. ‘Look what you’ve done to my prize tomatoes!’ Tip #6 Show emotions through action. If I write that the man was so upset at the dog burying a bone in his tomato patch that he got angry, I would be telling, not showing. In the next passage, the man’s loss of control and temper are shown by his shouting, high face colour, heavy breathing and irrational behaviour. The dog didn’t care about the prize tomatoes. He dragged his large bone further into the shelter of the tomatoes, destroying more of the plants. The man’s face was now as red as his spotted handkerchief. He was breathing heavily. If he had been a steam engine there would have been steam coming from his nose. ‘My tomatoes. My prize tomatoes!’ he howled. He ran after the dog through the tomato plants. He swung his heavy, mud-laden garden boot forward into a kick. But the dog ducked low to the ground. The man missed the dog and overbalanced. He fell down, flattening even more of his precious tomato plants. Even on the ground, the man flailed about, trying to grab the dog. The dog dropped his bone and turned to have another go at the man. But the man managed to clamp the dog’s muzzle shut. He pulled the dog’s head closer. Tip #7 Think of an original ending. For a short story that is humorous, an unusual finish can be exciting. ‘Bite me, would you?’ the man shouted. ‘How do you like being bitten?’ The man chomped his large teeth on the floppy dog’s ear. He bit down, hard. The dog howled in pain and tried to pull away, but the man’s teeth were too firmly attached. The dog whined and stopped struggling. He was beaten. He had never heard of humans biting dogs before. The man let go. He spat out dog hair and blood and stood up. ‘Now get out of my garden and stay out,’ he screamed. ‘And take your bone with you!’ he yelled and hurled the bone after the fleeing dog.

About Blog Podcast Videos Contact How We Created The Best Freelance Marketplace On The Internet Facebook Twitter + Are you unhappy with the lack of clients you are getting as a freelance web designer? We know, we asked, and we understood the need for a great place that connects freelancers with clients but we couldn’t find a good solution to recommend. Existing job boards, crowd sourcing sites and freelance marketplaces all seem to undervalue designers and serve clients with cheap solutions. Then we spoke with a few of our entrepreneur friends and guess what? – The hardest part for them is finding talented designers and developers! The world needs a better way to find the perfect designer or developer. And freelancers need a better way to get more and better clients. We believe we’ve created that better way. Do you want to know how AwesomeWeb hold against top 8 freelance marketplaces? Read this huge research article about pros and cons of each of them. It’s called AwesomeWeb! To kick it off with a boom, we invited 12 of the best designers and developers on the Internet to help mentor you! Find a Web Designer or Developer · AwesomeWeb …and these are the best designers and developers that you could find from around the globe! The Problem with Finding More Clients After climbing through every job board, crowd sourcing site, and freelance marketplace we could find, they all had one thing in common- they all catered to the client while putting up a barrier between you and them. Job boards allow clients to post projects that generally go to the lowest bidder. Crowd sourcing sites attract the low-end clients who expect hundreds of designers to work for free. The big freelance marketplaces are flooded with agencies who have worked for thousands of clients. How are you supposed to compete? Maybe they’re right. Maybe there’s a reason they all appeal to the client. Maybe that’s the best way to maximize profits and build out their companies. But we believe there is a large and growing group of under-served entrepreneurs, designers, and developers who value quality over cost, people who want to make the web more awesome. The Feedback from Beta Testers Earlier this month we started beta testing the site. People loved it! We had over 300 applications for 20-30 spots. They couldn’t wait to get in, create their accounts and showcase their work. beta-testers …and here’s the launching of a marketplace to search for awesome web designers and developers! Email after email started rolling in. “That is an awesome idea, honestly. Your work should have a fair chance in the market and the client should come to you, rather than being pressured into hiring the big dog. I feel that is one of the major areas that Elance and Freelancer went wrong. They made it to where companies came in and basically took over the market (having employees posing as freelancers) because they were able to approach the client, rather than the other way around. Sure, they had to be invited in the end, after presenting a proposal…but when they dress up their proposal with less than minimum wage rates and ‘thousands of websites built to date’, how is a single freelancer supposed to compete with that?” ~ Andrew R., designer “Right now, I believe that the bar is set pretty low on popular sites like oDesk, Freelancer, etc. I get the feeling that your project wants to change that.” ~ Liviu M., designer “I am all for helping expand opportunities for designers and clients to meet in a forum that is fair to both. I was a Codeable vendor and resigned due to policies that only favored the client and not the designer.” ~ Jonathan F., designer “Too many companies are conned into using services like PeoplePerHour or Fiverr and end up with substandard work.” ~ Simon P., designer “I am all for better way to connect the right web designers to the right clients. It shouldn’t take scouring Google, Craigslist, oDesk, or Freelancer for days just to find a good web designer. Let’s make it fast, simple, and easy” ~ Charley L., designer Talented designers from around the world are clamoring for a better solution. We’re Like You. We’ve been there… Before we tell you what we have built, we want to share our partner Nicholas Tart’s story because it is important for you to know where we’re coming from and why we created this project: “As a freelance web designer and front-end developer, it took me two years to build up a modest client base. I started at $15 per hour, built a few sites, increased my rate, built a few more sites, and increased my rate again. The cycle continued but it could’ve happened much faster. I was nowhere near capacity. So I started looking into my options. I hated the concept of crowdsourcing. I’d rather focus on my side projects than work for a 1-in-100 chance at getting paid. Then I looked through the freelance marketplaces and found nothing but a sea of $100 projects. I’m sure these sites work for some people, but it wasn’t for me. Without finding anything that could help, I continued to take on a few clients per year while managing my existing clients. I was able to pay my bills but my days were never full with billable work. I could only imagine what it’d be like working at $50-100 per hour, 40 hours per week. And to have enough work coming in that I could start turning clients away. It’d be a dream! There was nowhere for a freelancer like me. Someone who has several years of experience building $3K – $10K websites, who was only a few $10K projects away from opening up an agency or being able to focus on my side projects part time. That’s when I started working with Michael and Dainis on this project called AwesomeWeb! ~ Nicholas Tart The Beginnings of AwesomeWeb about-team …these are the faces of the amazing and brilliant people who designed and created AwesomeWeb. In January of this year I met with Nick and Michael Dunlop at a cabin in New Forest, England to establish the foundation of what is now AwesomeWeb. Michael Dunlop (founder of IncomeDiary and PopupDomination) is well-known in the Internet marketing community. His software has been viewed over a billion times. The number one question he receives is “Can you recommend a good designer?” We set out to build a simple freelance marketplace for people who do and need awesome work. The concept is built on three principles: If you’re a website owner, it should be simple to find talent and choose who you work with. If you’re a freelancer, you should be hired based on the merits of your work. The purpose of a freelance marketplace is to connect clients and freelancers with the perfect clients and freelancers. …without barriers. Our developer, Stefanos Ioannou, happened to be in the UK at the time, so he joined us for a weekend. Then I told them about my designer, Michael Burns, who we brought into the project just a few hours later. We had our team. We had our foundation. It was just a matter of building it. Easy right? How Does AwesomeWeb Work? How would you like to focus on building awesome websites without worrying about finding new clients? Not only that, how would you like to choose your clients rather than begging them to choose you? iterations-awesomweb …different design styles brought by the awesomeness of AwesomeWeb developers. AwesomeWeb is a subscription-based freelance marketplace. For a flat $17 per month, you’ll be able to create an account, choose your skills, upload a few projects, request endorsements and sit back as clients sell themselves to you. No more percentage of project fees. No more waiting for a Big Brother marketplace to hand you a measly project. If you have the skills that clients are looking for, and you have the portfolio to back it up, clients will contact you. If they don’t, leave within 90 days and we’ll give you your money back. One good client will pay for your account for life. In a few short weeks, we’ll be opening AwesomeWeb to a limited number of freelancers. In the meantime, make sure you enter to win an AwesomeWeb Scholarship below.

When Michael, Nick, and I were on a walk out in New Forest back in January, we brainstormed on how to launch AwesomeWeb. We considered an iPad giveaway, but that would’ve been gimmicky and overdone. Then we thought about giving away 100 of the best design and development books. It would’ve been better, but what if we could give people the chance to talk directly to the authors of those books? Nothing is more valuable than the time and wisdom of a mentor. So that’s what we went with. It took a lot of work to get these people onboard, but they’re ready and excited to help.

Comments Mithun November 15, 2014 at 04:03 I explored awesomeweb. It’s just awesome. There are plenty of developers and other freelancers out there. But my concern is if it could outrun fiverr.com where people are selling their services for less than $20. I know awesomeweb offer some expert freelancer, but still when it comes to spending money, newbies are more likely to hire a cheap developer. What do you think? Regards, Mithun komol hossain November 13, 2014 at 03:10 Hi, Dainis, Your article should be read by those people whole think about outsourcing. I have learn form your article i hope your next article will be more knowledgeable and i’m waiting for this. Free Vector November 7, 2014 at 11:32 Great work guys.. Brian Jackson November 4, 2014 at 13:55 Hi Dainis; To be honest i don’t like reading long articles but this is totally great for a newbie designer Greg October 20, 2014 at 17:39 I am a freelancer, and often hire others. It’s not difficult to find skilled people to do something. The hard part is to find people who will not quit in the middle of project, leaving you. John September 24, 2014 at 06:28 Superb work I must say. I was looking for a platform like this since long, but still don’t seem to find it (As I am looking for SEO freelancing ;) ) Kindly take SEO into consideration and include it in Awesome web or maybe make a similar one for SEO :D Thanks Ali Qayyum September 20, 2014 at 02:53 hi Dainis Graveris Really informative case study for getting more clients. I was making a few mistakes! And really fed up. AwesomeWeb is a really great service. I am definitely will try it. Tauseef Alam September 6, 2014 at 09:15 Hi Dainis Totally awesome. being a freelance designer, now i have a much better platform. This is something unique. Now it looks like the time has come to say bye bye to Elance/PeoplePerHour Dainis Graveris September 6, 2014 at 11:39 We really hope so Tauseef! :) Thiago September 5, 2014 at 18:48 Just saw the discussion above, about the value that is perceived, and that is right at the point we are going through today. I believe that if a person cannot see the inherent value that a service provides, he will always think it is expensive. If he can see that value, than he will never think it is expensive, because it will bring more benefits than he is paying for, and that is the kind of costumer you want to do walk that extra mile for. Dainis Graveris September 6, 2014 at 00:42 Thiago, thanks for jumping in. That’s exactly the point – if you would know that you can put 1 dollar in machine and get 2 dollars out wouldnt you do it? The same way we all buy products because we know what we can do with that knowledge or service to multiply our income. Good rule to remember is each product we buy should give us 10x in return..otherwise either product is bad or we are not doing what we should. Andrzej "Nigel" Pach September 5, 2014 at 03:57 As a freelance designer this seems like a great new place to explore! These are big words and a great responsibility to take on a new marketplace like this, but I guess who else than 1stwebdesigner is eliglibe to do that :D ? Time will show but definately will be looking closely into it Dainis Graveris September 5, 2014 at 05:46 Yeah..that’s why we teamed up to make it happen!! :) Thanks for support, Andrzej! Sohil Memon September 5, 2014 at 02:09 Awesome Project guys! I really appreciate your work and I must say that ‘A new Era is coming for Designers, Developers and Entrepreneurs’. Hats off! Keep going going in this way and no one can stop you! Dainis Graveris September 5, 2014 at 02:12 Ah thanks Sohil – doing our best and will overcome all challenges! Hope to see you joining mentorship though!! It’s a great opportunity to get free help! :) saqib ahmad September 4, 2014 at 22:41 wow! this is nice project and totally a new and creative side you showed in this.

Ouh yes, Internet is bringing so much possibilities for simple people to create world-changing projects! It wasnt possible before, it was so expensive to build anything – now it’s not so expensive, but you need a good cause and you need to put in some hard work! kenny moreno September 4, 2014 at 20:02 Great Project keep it up man you and your team are awesome! Dainis Graveris September 4, 2014 at 22:29 Thank you Kenny! We are working hard to make it awesome and create a better place for freelancers to find work easily so they can do what they are really good at, worrying less about finding work. Roberto September 4, 2014 at 14:25 So, before the designers made little money and now they PAY to work! Yeah, much better!!! lol Dainis Graveris September 4, 2014 at 22:28 Roberto, did you actually read the post? And are you actually freelancer yourself? Nicholas Tart September 5, 2014 at 00:14 Roberto, I appreciate you bringing up the objection. That was one of Dainis’s concerns too. The reason every other freelance marketplace is free to register is because the freelancer (or agency employee in most cases) is the product being sold. As long as the client is their customer, they cater to the client. As long as the freelancer is our customer, we can do what’s best for the freelancer. We believe, no matter where in the world you live, that $17/month will be 1/100th of the value that we can provide. If you read the article and considered your opinion before you commented on it, then we must not have clearly explained that. Aksam Zarook September 11, 2014 at 22:26 That’s a sad comment Roberto. I’m a freelancer struggling to get new clients. I’m also from Sri Lanka so $17 is a substantial fee for me but I don’t mind paying it. Like Nicholas says if this new venture for freelancers delivers as promised it will cover the cost. I’ve tried those free freelancer sites. They work just like described in this article. Undervalue our service and time. So I’m ready to give this project a try. Naba Now September 15, 2014 at 04:47 I am Agree with you. Thanks for your Feedback. Andy Flint September 3, 2014 at 16:35 I really, really do hope this project develops how you guys envisage it should. But I’m concerned that it may just get hijacked by agencies posing as freelancers and just become a premium version of the various sites you mentioned above. Dainis Graveris September 4, 2014 at 22:32 Andy, we will do our best not to allow it to happen and encourage freelancers to collaborate (agency like). Independent designers collaborating with good project managers, with good developers to get fighting chance with agencies. Freelancers have one pretty big benefit – they are small. They can move quickly, where agencies quickly start to become slow with all politics. I really believe that our team can do it – we have excellent client perspective, excellent freelancer perspective and serious – WHY to do the right thing! Nicholas Tart September 5, 2014 at 00:04 Andy, Dainis is right. We want to serve people like ourselves. Plus, we have a screening process for new accounts. We’re going to grow slowly and methodically. I hope it goes the way we envision it too. David Fraiser September 3, 2014 at 13:35 Great idea, but good God is this a loooooong page… *sigh* Dainis Graveris September 5, 2014 at 02:09 haha, what do you mean David?

The blue graph shows the apparent percentage (not the absolute number) of marine animal genera becoming extinct during any given time interval. It does not represent all marine species, just those that are readily fossilized. The labels of the "Big Five" extinction events are clickable hyperlinks; see Extinction event for more details. (source and image info)

An extinction event (also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis) is a widespread and rapid decrease in the amount of life on Earth. Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of macroscopic life. It occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the rate of speciation. Because the majority of diversity and biomass on Earth is microbial, and thus difficult to measure, recorded extinction events affect the easily observed, biologically complex component of the biosphere rather than the total diversity and abundance of life.[1]

The age of the Earth is about 4.54 billion years.[2][3][4] The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago,[5][6][7] during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon. There are microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia.[8][9][10] Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland.[11] More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species,[12] that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.[13][14] Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million,[15] of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described.[16]

Extinction occurs at an uneven rate. Based on the fossil record, the background rate of extinctions on Earth is about two to five taxonomic families of marine invertebrates and vertebrates every million years. Marine fossils are mostly used to measure extinction rates because of their superior fossil record and stratigraphic range compared to land organisms.

Since life began on Earth, five major mass extinctions have significantly exceeded the background extinction rate. The most recent, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately 66 million years ago (Ma), was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time. In addition to the five major mass extinctions, there are numerous minor ones as well and the ongoing mass-extinction caused by human activity is sometimes called the sixth extinction. Mass extinctions seem to be a Phanerozoic phenomenon, with extinction rates low before large complex organisms arose.[17]

Estimates of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540 million years range from as few as five to more than twenty. These differences stem from the threshold chosen for describing an extinction event as "major", and the data chosen to measure past diversity.

Major extinction events

In a landmark paper published in 1982, Jack Sepkoski and David M. Raup identified five mass extinctions. They were originally identified as outliers to a general trend of decreasing extinction rates during the Phanerozoic,[18] but as more stringent statistical tests have been applied to the accumulating data, the "Big Five" cannot be so clearly defined, but rather appear to represent the largest (or some of the largest) of a relatively smooth continuum of extinction events.[18]

    Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (End Cretaceous, K-T extinction, or K-Pg extinction): 66 Ma at the Cretaceous(Maastrichtian)-Paleogene(Danian) transition interval.[19] The K–T event is now officially called the Cretaceous–Paleogene (or K–Pg) extinction event in place of Cretaceous-Tertiary. About 17% of all families, 50% of all genera[20] and 75% of all species became extinct.[21] In the seas it reduced the percentage of sessile animals (those unable to move about) to about 33%. All non-avian dinosaurs became extinct during that time.[22] The boundary event was severe with a significant amount of variability in the rate of extinction between and among different clades. Mammals and birds emerged as dominant land vertebrates in the age of new life.
    Triassic–Jurassic extinction event (End Triassic): 201.3 Ma at the Triassic-Jurassic transition. About 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species went extinct.[20] Most non-dinosaurian archosaurs, most therapsids, and most of the large amphibians were eliminated, leaving dinosaurs with little terrestrial competition. Non-dinosaurian archosaurs continued to dominate aquatic environments, while non-archosaurian diapsids continued to dominate marine environments. The Temnospondyl lineage of large amphibians also survived until the Cretaceous in Australia (e.g., Koolasuchus).
    Permian–Triassic extinction event (End Permian): 252 Ma at the Permian-Triassic transition. Earth's largest extinction killed 57% of all families, 83% of all genera and 90% to 96% of all species[20] (53% of marine families, 84% of marine genera, about 96% of all marine species and an estimated 70% of land species, including insects).[23] The evidence of plants is less clear, but new taxa became dominant after the extinction.[24] The "Great Dying" had enormous evolutionary significance: on land, it ended the primacy of mammal-like reptiles. The recovery of vertebrates took 30 million years,[25] but the vacant niches created the opportunity for archosaurs to become ascendant. In the seas, the percentage of animals that were sessile dropped from 67% to 50%. The whole late Permian was a difficult time for at least marine life, even before the "Great Dying".
    Late Devonian extinction: 375–360 Ma near the Devonian-Carboniferous transition. At the end of the Frasnian Age in the later part(s) of the Devonian Period, a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera[20] and 70% of all species.[citation needed] This extinction event lasted perhaps as long as 20 million years, and there is evidence for a series of extinction pulses within this period.
    Ordovician–Silurian extinction events (End Ordovician or O-S): 450–440 Ma at the Ordovician-Silurian transition. Two events occurred that killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species.[20] Together they are ranked by many scientists as the second largest of the five major extinctions in Earth's history in terms of percentage of genera that went extinct.

Despite the popularization of these five events, there is no fine line separating them from other extinction events; using different methods of calculating an extinction's impact can lead to other events featuring in the top five.[26]

The older the fossil record gets, the more difficult it is to read. This is because:

    Older fossils are harder to find as they are usually buried at a considerable depth.
    Dating older fossils is more difficult.
    Productive fossil beds are researched more than unproductive ones, therefore leaving certain periods unresearched.
    Prehistoric environmental can disturb the deposition process.
    The preservation of fossils varies on land, but marine fossils tend to be better preserved than their sought after land-based counterparts.[27]

It has been suggested that the apparent variations in marine biodiversity may actually be an artifact, with abundance estimates directly related to quantity of rock available for sampling from different time periods.[28] However, statistical analysis shows that this can only account for 50% of the observed pattern,[citation needed] and other evidence (such as fungal spikes)[clarification needed] provides reassurance that most widely accepted extinction events are real. A quantification of the rock exposure of Western Europe indicates that many of the minor events for which a biological explanation has been sought are most readily explained by sampling bias.[29]

Research completed after the seminal 1982 paper has concluded that a sixth mass extinction event is ongoing:

    6. Holocene extinction: Currently ongoing. Extinctions have occurred at over 100 times the background extinction rate since 1900. The mass extinction is considered a result of human activity.[30][31]

Evolutionary importance

Mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on Earth. When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is "superior" to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.[34][35]

For example, mammaliformes ("almost mammals") and then mammals existed throughout the reign of the dinosaurs, but could not compete for the large terrestrial vertebrate niches which dinosaurs monopolized. The end-Cretaceous mass extinction removed the non-avian dinosaurs and made it possible for mammals to expand into the large terrestrial vertebrate niches. Ironically, the dinosaurs themselves had been beneficiaries of a previous mass extinction, the end-Triassic, which eliminated most of their chief rivals, the crurotarsans.

Another point of view put forward in the Escalation hypothesis predicts that species in ecological niches with more organism-to-organism conflict will be less likely to survive extinctions. This is because the very traits that keep a species numerous and viable under fairly static conditions become a burden once population levels fall among competing organisms during the dynamics of an extinction event.

Furthermore, many groups which survive mass extinctions do not recover in numbers or diversity, and many of these go into long-term decline, and these are often referred to as "Dead Clades Walking".[36]

Darwin was firmly of the opinion that biotic interactions, such as competition for food and space—the ‘struggle for existence’—were of considerably greater importance in promoting evolution and extinction than changes in the physical environment. He expressed this in The Origin of Species: "Species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting causes…and the most import of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered…physical conditions, namely the mutual relation of organism to organism-the improvement of one organism entailing the improvement or extermination of others".[37]

The effects of mass extinctions on plants are somewhat harder to quantify, given the biases inherent in the plant fossil record. Some mass extinctions (such as the end-Permian) were equally catastrophic for plants, whereas others, such as the end-Devonian, did not affect the flora.[88]

Notes

    Dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events; and marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains were less likely to be disrupted.

    Startup in biotech adds two base pairs to genetic code — and life on earth may never be the same

Startup in biotech adds two base pairs to genetic code — and life on earth may never be the same

Amidst the staggering diversity that is life on earth, there is a surprising thread of commonality. That shared ground is the language of genetics. Prior to the discovery of DNA, few suspected that a single molecular code could underpin such a panoply of biological forms – everything from viruses to talking apes. Even more startling was the discovery that this code consisted of a molecular language only four base pairs in length. It took evolution a billion years to devise this four-letter chemical code. Now for the first time in recorded history, organisms with a new, expanded, genetic code are taking shape in the laboratory. It’s no exaggeration to say that life on earth will never be the same.

While the playboy of biology, Craig Venter, has stolen many of the recent headlines in regards to synthetic biology, the more interesting advances in the field are occurring with surprisingly little fanfare. And not without good reason: many of the corporate labs pursuing synthetic biology have little cause to draw excess attention to themselves. They’ve learned all too well from the disastrous backlash against genetically modified foods that the public is not necessarily the wisest arbiter of scientific advancement. If we were to ban GMO crops tomorrow, half the population of the world would starve in short order. Yet this seems to be precisely what a large percentage of the “well-fed” in places like the United States are angling for. But I digress.

In a development sure to have far reaching repercussions, scientists working at the drug discovery company called Synthorx quietly announced that it is using an expanded version of the genetic alphabet, one that includes two novel base pairs dubbed X and Y, to create a type of E. coli bacteria never before seen on the face of the earth. While the potential for using these new, hybrid life forms to create wonder drugs is indeed enormous, that is merely the tip of the iceberg. The addition of two base pairs to the four letter DNA code effectively raises the number of possible amino acids an organism could use to build proteins from 20 to 172.

To gain an appreciation for the scope of this difference, just imagine that the entire array of life on the planet was increased eightfold. If you thought those freakish-looking deep sea fish dredged up by ocean vessels looked alien, those are practically our brothers and sisters compared with an organism that would employ a six-letter DNA code.

While the potential benefits to humanity and indeed the earth’s ecosystem are enormous, the dangers are equally staggering. On one hand, earth is flirting with its sixth extinction event, and an expanded genetic code has the potential to greatly revitalize the store of diversity found across on the globe. On the other side of the equation, these new hybrid species could have the effect that many non-native organisms often do when introduced to a new eco-system, obliterating the indigenous life forms.

While the scientists involved promise they are taking adequate measures to ensure these new organisms don’t break out of the lab and run amok, it’s always possible they will evolve some means for escaping their environmental confines and colonize new and uncharted territory. It wouldn’t be the first time this has happened, just look at the emergence of one biped ape out of Africa.

Body:
It was all over the news that day. It was really the only thing anybody would be watching for weeks. "How could this happen?" Andrew thought as he watched the carnage on live television play out like some sort of sick joke. Why wasn't the news editing out all those people falling to their deaths as the hotel was being taken over floor by floor? Why were they so enamored with the shock and the terror?
Only one explanation could penetrate his head. Nothing like this had ever happened before. As Front News Channel 9 kept relating the events, Andrew began pulling on his rubber blanket with dazed eyes. His eyes were watery and he wanted to cry but every time he was about to he felt like the voice of the newscaster would come on and as she read the report on the events being displayed each of her statements would hit Andrew like a slab of drywall across his cheek. This was sobering as Andrew had been in shock for almost two hours and was now beginning to remember that he wasn't just part of the event, he was, in many ways at the center of it.
 of a sixty two story building exploding from the penthouse as fifteen year old Tommy Flaman swan dived off the rooftop? The more Andrew realized what was happening, the less it made sense. Until he finally saw the final body hit the news van. Tommy's body hit the van with a thunderous crash that sent most of the equipment in the van spilling and shooting out broken parts of plastic and bent metal. The crash came with such a force that the shrapnel had awoken Andrew from the daze that he had been as he now remembered where he was. Outside the news van viewing the live feed from Front News Channel 9. Their van was parked on the other side of the street next to the ambulance where Andrew had been given medical assistance.

After all, there is no other way to attack this type of event.

Body:
People say that they don't know what it's like to be inside the mind of a crazy person but they do. Being crazy is inside all of us. It's under the hood. Beneath the skin. It's irking and lurking and trying desperately to leach it's way out. Consciousness. Sometimes we block and try to numb it with our everyday senses... But there's no escaping the truth. You are no more human than an ant is an ant. Take any animal from the animal kingdom. You could do this with any plant really anything that we consider to be alive but for the sake brevity it would be easier to pick something that has eyes and a mouth. That thing whatever it is: a horse, a dolphin, a bear, a spider. Take good look at it and clear your mind and hold that animal in your line of site. Keep looking at it and do not think about anything else. Are you ready? Now as you are looking at it forget what it is called. Erase the human classification you have given it. Forget all that you know or think you know about it. Just look at it. There are no ants, no bears, no humans. These are all just words and constructs in our brains. Created to identify different patterns of what is essentially the same thing the will to exist. Everything, especially you and I are crazy because when you really think about it we could not really exist without the will of something or someone that came before us and created us from literally almost nothing. You are the fruit of something or somebody's efforts. You are very literally a living breathing walking talking work of art. And if you came from a monkey then it means at some point in the evolution a monkey created you. And now you rule over the monkey. How long before you are the monkey?

Every species holds a pattern but the breakout species is where things begin to convert and break those patterns. There is a word for this in biology. A moment where the pattern is broken and consequently a new pattern emerges. The creation of a new expression of the old but different and from then on it takes off into becoming its own thing. Evolution. Maybe.

Maybe? What the fuck do you mean maybe?

Old man: what I mean is there will never be a real way to prove all of this. We are not equipped as a species to handle this kind of information and use it to our advantage. People are way to preoccupied with their own agendas. We're still to stupid to realize we are no better than giant ants. The philosophical nature of our potential however was meant to be much more than that. Not because we're human mind you. No a human is just a classification of a pattern. True human is a much more elevated term than homo erectus in that it is idealized. But that is were the potential comes in insnt it. We are more than our brethren species because we idealize ways to break that pattern much faster, much quicker. So why are we so afraid because in our own righteous search to break the pattern we have become hyper aware of our own mortality. We can now taste our death. And so fear sets in. We detract; we pull back. We begin to behave once again as animals. Survival, Darwinism. Devolution sets in but also primitive belief systems trump over logic which confuse our senses and corrupt our instincts. More people died from the reaction to 911 than from 911 itself.

Chapter 1: A PR nightmare

It started with the bells ringing. Nobody knew why every church for miles was ringing their bells or how they even got the news first but an hour in everyone got the news. The Americans were getting out. It wasn't something all to clear at first but as me and my family gathered around our sixty inch plasma television, I began recording as it soon became all too obvious what was happening. We were witnessing an event in history. After one hundred years of Americanization of the island of Puerto Rico, the U.S. was now dumping us like a surplus of toxic ordinance.

That was in a nutshell what we had become. Toxic. After Spanning months and months of petitioning on the Senate and being ignored, our politicians had been finally granted an audience with the Republican and Democratic parties for a right to dissolvancy in way of the deficit and all debts amassed by the island. It was a bad situation made worse by the fact that Puerto Rico had never been fully acknowledged by Americans as a territory even though it had been so for more than a hundred years. In the eyes of investors and American interests PR and all its inhabitants were as American as popcorn. In the eyes of the people however, we were just immigrants with hall passes. 

It was clear to us now, we would never be considered equals, that just wasn't the kind of world we lived in.


It's easy to think of a place as an extension of who you are; and in many ways it really is. However what makes that place yours isn't really the place but the people. Your people are not necessarily your people unless they really are your people. Anybody can have your back and yet most people do not. The way to let go of such notions of who and what it is you owe credence to is to assess the people around you in a matter not unlike the way you assess which foods in the fridge have gone bad. The difference being that you don't throw away the bar foods. Instead you collect it and store it or you burry it in the soil. In the end, it's all dirt.

The sea levels rising:

The ship reverberated with the bodies of the men as every single one of them hit the wall outside the main deck. The storm was cutting loose and they had no other means with which to winch whatever it was that they were dragging. Slowly but surely the waves had begun to compound one by one in the middle of the day

. The sunlight along with any visibility had all but faded away.
the high winds were so rough, and so constant, had they not been as warm as they were they would have beaten the crew just on volume alone. Instead, it just blistered their spirits. They were aching but they knew the catch was to important to give way. They all knew what they had caught with their nets. They knew. but they also didn't know. They didn't know where thing had come from. They didn't know how it was this thing moved. How it was alive. They didn't know how it could appear to be so strong when they were attacking it and now that they dragging it halfway across the Atlantic. As the storm drew harder and colder the crew of the Atticus knew that they would be in for a long day. Seaman Neil Patrick Roberts motioned the captain. You're new here. You stay topside and circle the bow every fifteen minutes. Stay clear of the men unless first mate Blake signals you to join in. Sir, I don't understand if anything I should be down there testing for samples in the water. The captain gave Neil a stern look. Mr Roberts, When I gave you open space to conduct this treasure hunt of your I was under the impression we would be transporting a ten ton haul. Our contract said nothing at all about my ship being dragged halfway across the Atlantic by a Goddan U.S.O. 
I know captain but need I remind you of the clause in our agreement. It specifies the need to retrieve certain mechanisms pertaining the relationship of the findings in question. This captain is one of those mechanisms. This object could be the key to the Amliahacumbha. Object?! Said the captain screaming. This thing isn't moving like an object, Roberts.  It's shaking and kicking. As the captain said this he began walking and slid the main deck door open. As he pointed towards the bow of the ship Roberts and everyone could see a 12 meter wide saucer pulling the ship. It was going in the same direction which allowed for the ship to tug along but was doing it very eradicaly. The ship was constantly shifting shape. Almost like it was trying to cut loose from the nets but somehow not enough. This thing could have switched 90 degrees off course and dragged the ship from under itself or even flip it over but for some reason it wasn't. For all the Ruckus this disk was making, it wasn't fighting us, not really. It wanted us to follow it. The shifting and fighting could have many other explanations but none that bear consideration in Patrick's mind. Contract obligation dictates we keep on. So that's what we'll do said Patrick. We ride it out see where this thing takes us.

AND I TELL YOU FOR LAST TIME!!! THE PACKAGE IS ALREADY BACK ON ROUTE TO YOU. THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO FROM HERE. THIS IS NOT MY FAULT. 

WE WERE EXPECTING THE PACKAGE TO ARRIVE AT OUR HOUSE. WE LIVE AND WORK HERE. WE ARE ALWAYS HERE. 

I PAID AND YET I RECEIVED NOTHING. 

YOU CAN BLAME THE POST OFFICE ALL YOU WANT BUT IN THE END IT IS YOU, YES YOU!! 

WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE UNTIL I RECEIVE PACKAGE IN MY HANDS OUR TRANSACTION IS NOT COMPLETE. YOU GOT MY MONEY DELIVERED TO STRAIGHT TO YOUR ACCOUNT. IF THE BANK MADE A MISTAKE. I WOULD STILL HAVE TO PAY YOU, ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM ME NOT RECEIVING MY PACKAGE WHEN I ALREADY PAID FOR IT.

SINCE I DID NOT RECEIVE PACKAGE IN MY HANDS AND GAVE YOU MY MONEY. YOU!!!!!! ARE!!!!!! RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING THE GOODS PURCHASED!!!!!! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET THE POST OFFICE TO GIVE ME BACK MY REFUND OR MY PACKAGE? THEY DON'T DO THAT. THEY SAID ONCE IT'S ON ROUTE TO YOU. IT'S ON ROUTE TO YOU. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSACTION. THEY DON'T CHANGE PACKAGE DESTINATION MIDWAY, YOU IDIOT!!! YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS!!!!

CLEARLY YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE THIS AND YOU WANT TO KEEP MY MONEY AND BLAME SOMEONE ELSE FOR YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO OUR SELLER BUYER CONTRACT. I AM TIRED OF DEALING WITH YOU. I WILL SEEK ALIEXPRESS MEDIATION. MAYBE, I GET BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM THEM.

YOU ARE A VERY BAD AND IRRESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PERSON. NOT ONCE DID YOU EVEN OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION TO MINE. YOU COULDNT EVEN MEET ME HALFWAY.

KNOW THIS… IF I DON'T GET MY MONEY BACK IN MEDIATION… I WILL FIND A WAY TO TELL EVERYONE ON THIS SITE:

1. HOW POORLY YOU TREAT YOUR DISTRESSED CUSTOMERS WHEN PROBLEMS ARISE
2. HOW YOU BLAME THEM AND OTHERS FOR THINGS THAT ARE YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY
3. HOW YOU ARE UNREASONABLE AND CONSTANTLY COMPLAIN BLAMING THE POST OFFICE INSTEAD OF OFFERING SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE THE ISSUE.
4. HOW YOU HAVE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER OF SALESMANSHIP (IF YOU WERE A SMART PERSON YOU COULD HAVE CONVINCED ME TO BUY SOMETHING ELSE AND RESEND WITH PACKAGE INSTEAD OF CRYING LIKE A BABY YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE MONEY OUT OF AN INCONVENIENT SITUATION. THAT OPPORTUNITY IS NOW GONE. I NEVER WANT TO DEAL WITH YOU AGAIN.)
5. HOW YOU INSULT YOUR CUSTOMERS BY TREATING THEM LIKE CHILDREN AND CONDENSCENDING THEM BY CALLING THEM YOUR "FRIEND" WHILE YOU SPIT IN THEIR FACES. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO INSULTED IN MY LIFE BY AN ONLINE STORE.
6. HOW YOU ARE OBLIVIOUS AT HOW POOR YOU ARE AT YOUR JOB. THE ONLY WAY I CAN CONCEIVE YOU RECEIVE GOOD RATINGS ON THIS SITE IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOMEHOW FOUND A WAY TO CHEAT OR YOU ONLY GET GOOD MARKS BECAUSE SO FAR YOU'VE BEEN LUCKY.

and most importantly… 

7. HOW YOU STOLE MY MONEY. CLAIMED IT AS YOUR OWN BEFORE THE ENTIRE TRANSACTION WAS CONCLUDED AND JUDGING BY YOUR ATTITUDE, THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST TIME, I BET YOU LEAVE PEOPLE EMPTY HANDED AND TOOK THEIR MONEY. 

YOU SIR ARE A THIEF. A LOWLIFE AND A HORRIBLE MERCHANT. ALIEXPRESS SHOULD NOT ALLOW PEOPLE LIKE YOU ON THEIR SERVERS. AND YOU ARE NO FRIEND OF MINE SO DON'T PRETEND TO BE MY FRIEND. PAY ME BACK MY MONEY OR I WILL MAKE SURE EVERY ONE ON THIS SITE GETS FAIR WARNING BEFORE DEALING WITH YOUR SHITTY STORE.
